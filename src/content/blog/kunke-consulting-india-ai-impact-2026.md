Today, January 12, 2026, Błażej Kunke, founder of Kunke Consulting, attended the India AI Impact 2026 event at the Embassy of India in Warsaw. The gathering was an opportunity to listen, exchange perspectives, and learn more about the practical realities of collaboration between India and Poland.

The program highlighted the shared interest in technology and innovation, while also acknowledging the everyday challenges of building business bridges across borders. Conversations touched on cooperation models, policy context, and the concrete work required to translate strategic intent into working partnerships. For Kunke Consulting, this focus on practice over slogans resonated strongly.

We would like to thank the organizers for their leadership and hospitality: Mr Mohan Lal, Chargé d’Affaires of the Embassy of India, and Mr J. J. Singh, President of the Indo-Polish Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IPCCI). Their efforts made the event both substantive and welcoming.

At ^Kunke Consulting, we remain interested in practical, real-world AI adoption and in international cooperation that supports measurable progress. Events such as India AI Impact 2026 are valuable because they connect people who care about delivery, not just declarations. The discussions in Warsaw offered useful insights into how partners on both sides can move from shared goals to tangible results.

We appreciate the opportunity to participate in this thoughtful and well-organized meeting and look forward to continuing the conversation in future initiatives that strengthen India–Poland cooperation.
