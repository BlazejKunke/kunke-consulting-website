      <h1>About Me: Blazej Kunke</h1>
      <p>
        Hello! I'm Blazej Kunke, the founder of Kunke Consulting. With a background rooted in economics from Poznań University of Economics (Bachelor's and Master's), and valuable experience gained in the mutual funds sector and at McKinsey & Company, I bring a unique blend of strategic insight and practical application to the table.
      </p>
      <p>
        While I didn't complete my PhD, my academic journey deeply instilled in me a rigorous approach to problem-solving. Founding Kunke Consulting in December 2024 was a natural progression to offer direct, impactful consulting and training.
      </p>
      <p>
        My expertise lies in areas critical for modern businesses: **Excel proficiency, practical AI applications, and effective marketing strategies.** I strongly believe in the power of in-person training and consulting to foster genuine understanding and tailored solutions, though I am open to online engagements when necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        Based in Poznań, I frequently work with clients in Warsaw and Berlin, and I'm excited to expand Kunke Consulting's reach across Poland, Germany, the Czech Republic, and Sweden. Outside of work, I enjoy riding my bike, playing musical instruments, and diving into video games. I'm passionate about helping businesses thrive in an evolving digital landscape.
